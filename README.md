**We all love primes. Let me show you one more reason why!**

Here's my **final degree project**, supervised by Jesús Soto (Universidad de Sevilla). 

**Abstract:**

Primes are known to be the building blocks of numbers, and their beauty has fascinated mathematicians since the very beginning of time. 
While numerous formulas defining primes are found in literature, can they be elegantly expressed by a polynomial? This, and other related questions are the core of this dissertation.

**Key topics:**

- No polynomial can represent only primes. Moreover, no algebraic function can represent only primes. 

- Yet, there is a surprising twist: the existence of multivariable polynomials whose represented set of positive values is precisely the entire set of primes. We named this polynomials "prime enumerating polynomials”.

  - This result solves Hilbert’s Tenth Problem in the negative.
  - The construction of such a polynomial. 
  - Practical computations.
  - Minimum degree and number of variables required for this type of construction.
